scodec
======

scodec is a suite of libraries for working with binary data. Support ranges from simple, performant data structures for working with bits and bytes to streaming encoding and decoding.


There are three primary modules:

 - scodec-bits - Zero dependency library that provides persistent data structures, `BitVector` and `ByteVector`, for working with binary.
 - scodec-core - Combinator based library for encoding/decoding values to/from binary.
 - scodec-stream - Binding between scodec-core and [scalaz-stream](http://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream) that enables streaming encoding/decoding.

There are a few secondary modules as well:

 - scodec-spire - Binding between scodec-core and [spire](http://github.com/non/spire), mostly taking advantage of unsigned numeric types.
 - scodec-protocols - Library of general purpose implementations of common protocols.

This guide goes over each of these modules in detail.
